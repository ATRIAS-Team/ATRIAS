# South East Queensland Scenario

## Inputs

Details on how the scenario inputs were created can be found [here](https://github.com/agentsoz/ees-data/blob/qld/qld/south-east-queensland/#readme).
In addition to the inputs available here, two other inputs are required to run this south east queensland evacuation scenario:  the  MATSim road network (`south_east_qld_network_EPSG_7856.xml.gz`) and  the cyclone geojson file (`cyclone_progression_EPSG_4326.geojson.gz`). These files can be downloaded from [https://github.com/agentsoz/ees-data](https://github.com/agentsoz/ees-data/tree/qld/qld/south-east-queensland/scenarios).
