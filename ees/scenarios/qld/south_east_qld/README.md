# South East Queensland Scenario

## Inputs

Details on how the scenario inputs were created are [here](https://github.com/agentsoz/ees-data/blob/qld/qld/south-east-queensland/#readme). 
In addition to the inputs avaiable here, two other inputs are required to run this scenario:  the south east queensland MATSim road network (too large so stored elsewhere) and 
the cyclone propagation shape file. Contact Dhirendra Singh (dhi.singh@gmail.com) to obtain them.
