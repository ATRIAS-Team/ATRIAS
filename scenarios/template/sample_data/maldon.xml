<simulation>

<!-- define the matsim configuration file -->

<!-- Number of BDI agents (N) to initialise. The total number of 
     agents (M) is determined by the MATSim population file. 
     The final number of BDI agents will be the lesser of N,M.
     Setting N really high (so that it is always greater than M), 
     will ensure that the entire MATSim population has BDI conterparts

<!-- define data for the residents-->
<!-- relatives is a value (0.0-1.0) that defines the probability that a resident 
will have a relative in the town needing to be collected prior to evacuation-->
<!-- kids is a value (0.0-1.0) that defines the probability that a resident 
will have children in the town needing to be collected from school prior to evacuation-->
<!-- max_distance_to_relatives provides the maximum distance in metres from agents 
start location to relative's location-->
