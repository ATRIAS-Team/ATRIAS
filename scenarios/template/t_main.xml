<!--=========================================================================== 
This is the top level config file for the scenario.
Its primary role is to point to all of the other config
and input files required by the scenario.
============================================================================-->

<simulation>

<!--=========================================================================== 
Specifies the top level MATSim configuration file for this scenario
  name: 
    path to file; if using relative path, specify relative to the 
    bushfire root directory, e.g., ./sample_data/maldon.xml     
============================================================================-->
<matsimfile 
  name="${matsimfile_name}"
/>

<!--=========================================================================== 
Specifies the timestamped fire progression fire model file

  name: 
    path to fire model file; if using relative path, specify relative to the 
    bushfire root directory, e.g., scenarios/maldon-simple/maldon_fire.xml

  coordinates: 
    coordinate system used in the input file; should be one of {utm,latlong}

  format:
    fire file format; should be one of {geojson} 

For an example of the fire input file see ./sample_data/maldon_fire.json
============================================================================-->
<firefile 
  name="${firefile_name}" 
  coordinates="${firefile_coordinates}" 
  format="${firefile_format}"
/>

<!--=========================================================================== 
Specifies the geography file for this scenario
  name: 
    path to file; if using relative path, specify relative to the 
    bushfire root directory, e.g., scenarios/maldon-simple/maldon_geography.xml    
============================================================================-->
<geographyfile 
  name= "${geographyfile_name}" 
  coordinates="${geographyfile_coordinates}"
/>

<!--=========================================================================== 
Number of BDI agents (N) to initialise. 

The total number of agents (M) is determined by the MATSim population file 
(see ${matsimfile_name}).

The final number of BDI agents will be the lesser of N,M. Setting N really high 
(so that it is always greater than M), will ensure that the entire MATSim 
population has BDI conterparts.
============================================================================-->
<bdiagents 
  number="${bdiagents_number}"

<!--=========================================================================== 
Specify attributes that impact the behaviour of vehicles during evacuation

  relatives:
    the proportion of vehicles (between 0.0-1.0) that will first take a detour
    to a nearby location (determined by the max_distance_to_relatives value)
    to attend to loved ones (relatives), before evacuating towards the 
    designated relief centres.

  max_distance_to_relatives:
    the maximum distance (in mtrs) from an agent's start location to the detour
    location; for example setting this to 1000 will force vehicles that detour 
    to check on relatives to drive up to 1km to an arbitrarily chosen location
    prior to evacuating.
