Integration of Reinforcement Learning into the bdi architecture


This is the repo for our project integrating DRL into the cognitive bdi agent architecture.

We use Jadex for the cognitve agent architecture and consider trip requests from a bike sharing company. 

We compare the learning integration approach with the informed utility based approach. 

Our results are shown into the following quality measures.
