# Conservation Ethics modelling

Combined work with Sarah Bekessy, Ascelin Gordon, Fiona Fidler, 
Lin Padgham, Dhirendra Singh, Sayed Iftekhar, Graeme Doole.

See ./doc/cjae13-ihl.pdf for background work that this model is based on. 
In this work, we extend the landholder model so that it (1) is implemented
as a BDI agent (in JACK), and (2) models the notion of conservation ethics.
The ABM is modelled in GAMS.

For more information on the BDI-ABM integration project, 
see the top level README.
