This directory is a placeholder for downloading the visualiser.

To download the visualsier go to 
https://bitbucket.org/Kidney/fire-sim-unity/downloads

Download the latest build for your operating system: linux or windows.

Extract the zip file. This will create a new directory with a subdirectory and an executable program.

Move the contents of that directory here (or extract the contents to here directly).

Rename the executable program to FireSim.exe

Rename the data directory to FireSim_Data.

The run script in the parent directory should now be able to run the bushfire application with the visualiser.
