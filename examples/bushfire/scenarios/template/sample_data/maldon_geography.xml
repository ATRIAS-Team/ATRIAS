	The following data relates to defining regions etc for the town

	The geography file contains a list of locations. 
	These can be of the types:
		s = school
		e = evacuation point
		c = control point

	Schools are used for residents who have children. They will travel to
	one of the schools before evacuating.

	TODO check that zero and 2+ schools work correctly

	Evacuation points are where residents will evacuate too.

	Control points are used to define evacuation routes.

	Locations require a coordinate (easting, northing).

	The town is divided into "regions".
	If no regions are defined, the software assumes the whole area is one region.

	Routes are defined by a sequence of control points.
	If no routes are defined, a route with a single waypoint (the relief centre) is created for each region.
