	bypass can be used to turn on (false) or off (true)
	the functioning of the controller agent

	userControl can be used to enable (true) or disable (false) 
	user interacton via the GUI. That is, if disabled, the controller
	will make all decisions automatically and not allow the user to 
	interupt them

	choicePoints defines where a user will be given the option
	to interrupt the controller agent decision making
	
	name refers to a BDI goal for which a choice of plans can be made
	
	the manual option causes normal BDI plan selection to be overridden, allowing
	user selection in the GUI or with the choice attribute here
	
	the choice option names a plan to use to fulfill the goal, if manual is set to true
	and the visualiser GUI is inactive
	- note that currently, choosing a manual settings option (which expects a further
	    detailed response from the GUI) here will break the program

	TODO need to describe all options
