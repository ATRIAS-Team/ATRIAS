	The following data relates to defining regions etc for the town

	The geography file contains a list of locations. 
	These can be of the types:
		s = school
		e = evacuation point
		c = control point

	Schools are used for residents who have children. They will travel to
	one of the schools before evacuating.

	TODO check that zero and 2+ schools work correctly

	Evacuation points are where residents will evacuate too.

	Control points are used to define evacuation routes.

	Locations require a coordinate (lat, long).
	They should also refer to a link id that matches a link in the
	MATSim road network.
	TODO need to know why/ if this is required and how to calculate it.

	The town is divided into "regions".
	TODO check if zero regions works.
	Each region should have a route defined to each evac point.

	Routes are defined by a sequence of control points.
